# HTML Lists, CSS Boxes, JS Control Flow

From **DUCKETT HTML BOOK**, I learned that during creating a web page, there are in some parts on the page ,we may use the lists to arrange the information within it and in the HTML there are three types of the list that can be used and it can be nested inside one another, like :

* Ordered lists : these lists are used where each item inside it is numbered .

`<ol>`
`<li>item1</li>`
`<li>item2</li>`
`<li>item3</li>`
`<li>item4</li>`
`<li>item5</li>`
`</ol>`

* Unordered lists : these lists are used where each item it is not numbered .

`<ul>`
`<li>item1</li>`
`<li>item2</li>`
`<li>item3</li>`
`<li>item4</li>`
`<li>item5</li>`
`</ul>`

* Definition lists : are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

`<dl>`
`<dt>term1</dt>`
`<dd>defenitions</dd>`
`<dt>term2</dt>`
`<dd>defenetions</dd>`
`</d>`

Also, I got familiar with the boxes and saw how CSS treats each HTML element as if it lives in its own box.these treatments are like a control the dimensions of your boxes ,create borders around boxes,set margins and padding for boxes and show and hide boxes.
