# Introduction of ***HTML*** and ***JavaScript***

From **DUCKETT BOOK**, I learned that it is important to consider the different ways in which people access the web,like:

* ***Browsers*** :  these search engines can access websites  by type the address of website inside it,such as *opera* .

* ***Web Servers*** : these servers are special computers which are connected to the internet, and it's function to send web pages out to people who request them .

* ***Screen readers*** :these programs can read the content of screen to a user .

* ***Devices*** : there are several types of devices can accessing websites ,like: desktop computers laptops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## **How to create the website and How it work ?**

To create all types of the websites, the **HTML** and **CSS** languages will be used and there are some technology wil be used in order to improve and organize the performance of the website and help us achieve the goal of its establishment.

On the browser , when we typing the address of website , the browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server in order to find the location of web server that it will anywhere in the world .

## **The Structure of the website**

The following code is a simple HTML code that used elements to describe the structure of website page :

`<html>`

`<body>`

`<h1> Main Heading</h1>`

`<p>introduction <p>`

 `<h2> Sub-Heading</h2>`

`<p>Another Paragraph.</p>`

 `<h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>`

`<p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>`

`</body>`

`</html>`

The above elements ,between angular brackets,are called as closing and oppening. The oppening tags can carry attributes,these require a name and value, which tell us more about the content of that element.The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure .Also , there are some basic extra markup in the HTML,Like :

* **DOCTYPES** in the HTML code is used to tell the browsers which version of HTML that used .

* `<!-- and -->` marke  is used to add comments inside the code.

* `<iframes>` cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.

### **The Process & Design of the websites**

Before starting the design , there are many questions that must be taken in our consideration , like :

* who your target audience .
* why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.

After that , the steps of designing can be started , So you can use the site maps that allow you to plan the structure of a site and Wireframes that allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.Make sure the design can be differentiate between pieces of information by using styling format and using grouping and similarity to helps visitors understand the topic of your website .But the using of HTML language is not enough during the creation of a website , so we need to use another programming language ,like : JavaScript, that help to make the website more interactive.

So , To use such programming language,you need to become familiar with some  concepts ,ABC of programming, in the programming :

* ***What's a script and how do i create one ?***

* ***How do computers fit in the world around them ?***

* ***How do i write a script for a web page?***

The best using of this language during  the creating of a website is to keep JavaScript code in its own **JavaScript** file and **CSS** code in its own file then in the main code use  **HTML** element ,`<script>` ,
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file when the engine load the HTML page .
