# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

From **DUCKETT BOOK**, I learned that during creating a web page, the contents of a page includes within the tags (known as markup), these tags provide extra meaning and describe the structure of a page to the broswer in order to show the contents to a user .So , the chapter 2 from this book focus on two types pf these markup , like :

- **Structural markup**: these tags are used to describe both headings and paragraphs , like :
  - **Heading**  `<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>` .
  - **Paragraph**  `<h1>Paragraph</h1>` .
  - **Superscript & Subscript** `<sup>` `<sub>` .
  - **Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**  `<br />` `<hr />` .

- **Semantic markup**: these tags are used to provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, like :

  - **Strong & Emphasis** `<strong> <em>` .

  - **Qoutations** `<blockquote><q>` .

  - **Author Details** `<address></address>` .
