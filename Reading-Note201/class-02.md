# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS

</br>
</br>

From **DUCKETT BOOK**, I learned that during creating a web page, the contents of a page includes within the tags (known as markup), these tags provide extra meaning and describe the structure of a page to the broswer in order to show the contents to a user .So , the chapter 2 from this book focus on two types pf these markup , like :

- **Structural markup** : these tags are used to describe both headings and paragraphs , like :
</br>

  - **Heading**  `<h1>This is a Main Heading</h1>` .
  - **Paragraph**  `<h1>Paragraph</h1>` .
  - **Superscript & Subscript** `<sup>` `<sub>` .
  - **Line Breaks & Horizontal Rules**  `<br />` `<hr />` .

- **Semantic markup**: these tags are used to provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, like :
</br>

  - **Strong & Emphasis** `<strong> <em>` .

  - **Qoutations** `<blockquote><q>` .

  - **Author Details** `<address></address>` .
</br>
</br>

HTML tags are treated by CSS to appear inside its own box ,and the CSS uses rules to indicate how that tag should look. These Rules are made up of ***selectors***,which allow to target rules to specific tag in an HTML main file , and ***declarations***,which are the sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a *property* and a *value*, separated by a colon, to treat the HTMLtags.The addition of CSS features can be done by placing CSS rules in the same page in your HTML code or by using separate CSS file then link it in the HTML file.

From **DUCKETT JS BOOK**, I learned that the importance of using the JavaScript programming language in order to make the website more interactive . Like CSS , we can insert the JavaScript code inside the HTML file or by using separate JS file then call it from HTML file . And , i got familiar with some of it's instruction , like :

- **Comments** : `// put here your comment` .

- **Variables** : `var NameOfPioneers= value` .

There are rules to type the name of a variable,like : **It must not start with a number**,**It must not use a dash(-) or a period (.) in a variable name**  , **It must not have keywords or reserved words** , etc.And ,the value of variables in the JavaScript can be numbers, strings,Expressions, and true or false values known as Booleans.The Expressions in JS used too many operators , like : Arithmatic operators ,String operators and Logical operators.Also,I learned how to create and control the flow of data in your scripts by using loop and if Condition instructios and much more . The if-else statements allow you to run a set of code if a condition is true, and another one if it is false.And , The loop instruction has three types : for, while, and
do-while and each repeats a certain set of statements.
