# Structure web pages with HTML

From previous articles , I learned that if I want to build a website,  there are strategies for processing and designing it.Before doing any step , it's more imporatnat to think about who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.The next Stage is to make a site map and a wireframe in order to imagination , plan the structure of a website and know how to orgnize the informations inside the pages .Also, It should be taken into your consideration ,as a designer, that adding ***formatting ,images,sizing,and colors*** makes it easier for the reader to distinguish between paragraphs and **HTML tags support these feature and many more** , such as :


 - The `<span>` tag which is used to differentiate a specific text from  the surrounding texts.
 - This is,`<p class="important admittance">Write a Text</p>`,called tag with class attribute and here the value of the attribute represent that the texts inside the tag are headings and links.

 
All the next steps are based on your HTML5 coding skills that concern about knowing what tags, which are the elements that help to describe the web page structure and it's more important to use new versions of it in order to provide **clearer code**, are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
