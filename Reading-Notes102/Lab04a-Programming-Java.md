# Programming with JAVA  

  

For previous book, I learned that the JAVA language is used to build the website and I can use the **jQuery** with it in order to make programming much easier. So, I need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming, like a definition of **script**, it's just a series of instructions to achieve certain goals, and how to create it and how the **script** can achieve my goals. Also, I learned that to achieve the goals of the website, the big task of the pages must be divided into small series task then work on each task separately with the keeping in mind that using a flowchart makes this much easier.  

  

Like other programming language, the JAVA language includes too many **expression** and **operators** that used when I write the **script**.so, I got familiar with some of them, like an expression that just assign a value to a variable, expressions that use two or more values to return a single value and assignment, comparison and string operators.
