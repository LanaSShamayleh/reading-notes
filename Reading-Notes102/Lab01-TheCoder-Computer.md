# Linux operating system

Linux operating system have both command line and graphical user interface as any another operating system , these used  to excute the instructions .

A command line ,or terminal, is the side that you can interface with the system and excute the instructions by typing the commands over it from the keyboard and the feedback will be a text , and there are a lot of commands in order to deal proper with system , such as :  *ls* pwd  *cd* mkdir . To open the terminals this depend on the current operating system .
Moving around the system will by specific commands . The first command is pwd , and it tells you what your current working directory is if you lose track of where you are at. Knowing what's in your current location will be by using ls command , but this command will not appear all files exit in the current location so you can add additional arguments to list of all hidden files .
Changing your current location can be done by using cd commands by specify the new location after the command with space between them.
There are two types of path , absolute and relative . Absolute path means that a directory location in relation to the root of the file system. and relative path means that a  directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.

To learn much more how to use command line and it's commands, let's we talk about a file . Everything inside our system is a file , the text file is a file and the keyboard is a file , so it's more important to know how manage the files and directories on the Linux system . There are many types of the files , each one has different extension and this extension usually consist of 2 -4 characters and it's location become after the full name of the file . The following examples show some of the file type in the system :

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.

For people who new to Linux , there's a problem that you may encounter like a case sensitive ,this system is not like other operating systems, So be aware of case sensitivity when dealing with command line options .
Also be aware of a space , a space on the command line is how we separate items.
You may use either single or double quote around the items after the command , and anything inside quotes is considered a single item . also, you may use escape character, which is a backslash ( \ ). What the backslash does is escape  the special meaning of the next character.
It's important to know any file in the Linux system begin with a full stop so it's considered as a hidden file and if you deal with ls command and you need to list some hidden files , you can add additional argument  ( -a ) after the ls command.
