## Operators and Loops

From Duckett book, I learned that the comparison and logical operators are used in the logical instructions to determine equality or difference between the values, these operators are used to test for true or false, and there are many comparison operators, like:  

- ==    equal to

- ===   equal value and equal type

- !=    not equal

- '>'=    greater than or equal to

Also, I learned that if I need to repeat the actions for several times, So Loops are a way to repeat the same code multiple times. There are two types of it, such as:  

- The (while) loop :

 while (condition) {  

 // code //  

  }

- The (For) loop:  

for (initialization; condition; counter) {

 // code  //

 }
