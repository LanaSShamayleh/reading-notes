# Design web pages with CSS

From Duckett book, I learned that the CSS allows you to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. and these rules are made up of selectors which different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.

Using CSS allows to ues the colors which help convey the mood and evokes reactions. In addition to that, there are three ways to specify the colors :

- **RGB values** , like : **rgb(102,205,170)**  .

- **hex codes** , like : **#66cdaa**  .

- **color names** , like : **Black**  .

CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity ,It is known as RGBA,also allows you specify colors as ***HSL*** values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as ***HSLA***.
